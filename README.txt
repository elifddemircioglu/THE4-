HOW TO RUN THE TESTER ?

Put your code in the folder you downloaded with the name "the4.py"
Open your terminal go the same directory.
Write python or python3.

Then run:

>>> import tester
>>> tester.tester()

It should give the result :) 

Feel free to add new cases.
generator.py is a case generator but after it adds a case, case should be modified to make sense. Keep in mind when using.
